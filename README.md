## cscl-migrate

We wish to migrate the New York City Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) database from its legacy environment to some fancy new environments. Friends this our CSCL migration, our rules, the trick is never to be afraid.

The New York City Department of City Planning will produce the editing software in the target environment.  This repo is initially focused on migrating data to support this future software development.

### Overall Migration Plan

Here's a picture of the big picture.

![big picture](doc/bigpicture.png)

### You Will Need

1. arcpy from ArcGIS Pro 
2. arcpy from ArcMap (32 bit classic)
3. Classic 32 bit ArcCatalog (developed with 10.7.1)
4. ArcGIS Pro (developed with 3.5.x)
5. ArcGIS Pro Topographic Production toolbox license
6. sqlplus.exe
7. SQL access to the source database as the data owner and as SDE
8. SQL access to the target database as the data owner and as SDE


### 0. Stop Edits

Step 1 exports to a file geodatabase. The data flowing into that pipeline must continue to match the source environment until we export the archive in step 5.

### 1. Extract And Prepare CSCL

Review and update the environmentals.

```sh
> geodatabase-scripts\sample-cscl-extract.bat
```

Step 1 creates an empty file geodatabase. Then it use python 2 arcpy with class extension readers to copy/paste from the Enterprise Geodatabase to cscl-migrate.gdb. 

    \[dev|stg|prd]\cscl-migrate.gdb

### 2. Remove Class Extensions 

With ArcCatalog 10.7 or superior. 

1. Double click src/addin/ResetCLSIDs.esriaddin. In the utility window select "Install Add-In."  No admin rights required.
2. From ArcCatalog select Customize-Customize Mode - Toolbars. Create a new toolbar named your choice and check the box next it.
3. From ArcCatalog Customize-Customize Mode select the commands tab.  Search  for "Reset CLSIDs." Drag it to the toolbar.
ðŸ”´DANGER ZONE. CODE REDðŸ”´
4. In ArcCatalog select the file geodatabase and run the ResetCLSIDs AddIn.
5. It should be quick and return "Completed without errors"
6. Review the log. It should look (confusingly!) like the snippet below
7. Remove the toolbar. ðŸŸ¡CODE YELLOWðŸŸ¡

```
<snip>
Inspecting item 'AddressPoint', OID: 73
	Expected CLSID equals Actual CLSID, no change needed.
	Expected EXTCLSID: 
	Actual EXTCLSID: {D9D37706-8C4F-4C38-8849-3C407FC0AC84}
Inspecting item 'ALTSEGMENTDATA', OID: 74
<snip>
```

Sanity check success by viewing the file geodatabase from ArcGIS Pro.

### 3. Correct Resolution And Tolerance

Review and update the environmentals.

```bat
> geodatabase-scripts\sample-reprojectgdb.bat
```

This step will end with a warning "CSCL_Topology is missing!" This is expected. We will manually recreate the topology in the next step.

### 4. Load To Enterprise Geodatabase

In ArcGIS Pro copy all items in the file geodatabase. Paste into the enterprise geodatabase. This should run for about 2 hours. This step can't be scripted easily, only the magic GUI can deal with dependencies and avoid _1s.

Then complete the load by applying topology rules, versioning, grants, etc.

```bat
> geodatabase-scripts\sample-cscl-load.bat
```

### 5. Migrate Archive Classes

This step concludes by updating objectids of the base tables. Do not get clever and think that it can be run in parallel to earlier steps.

See [doc/archive-migration.md](doc/archive-migration.md) for details.

First compile 2 pl/sql packages in the source and target. 

```bat
sqlplus sde/****@srcdb @geodatabase-scripts\setup-sde-source.sql
sqlplus sde/****@targetdb @geodatabase-scripts\setup-sde-target.sql
sqlplus cscl/****@targetdb @geodatabase-scripts\setup-owner-target.sql
```

Then migrate. This will transfer all archive data and update object ids on the target.  

```bat
> geodatabase-scripts\sample-migrate-archive.bat
```

### Teardown 

To prevent catastrophe the teardown script will only proceed if a registered table named UNLOCK_TEARDOWN exists in the schema. Manually create this empty table to unlock teardown. 

```bat
> geodatabase-scripts\sample-cscl-teardown.bat
```

### Time Estimates

| Step        | Duration in Hours        |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1. Extract And Prepare CSCL         | 1   |
| 2. Remove Class Extensions          | 0   |
| 3. Correct Resolution And Tolerance | .5   |
| 4. Load To Enterprise Geodatabase   | 1.5   |
| 5. Migrate Archive Classes          | 1   |
| Teardown                            | .1   |
