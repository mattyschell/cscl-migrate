## cscl-migrate

We wish to migrate the New York City Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) database from its legacy environment to some fancy new environments. Friends this our CSCL migration, our rules, the trick is never to be afraid.

The New York City Department of City Planning will produce the editing software in the target environment.  This repo is initially focused on migrating data to support this software development.
